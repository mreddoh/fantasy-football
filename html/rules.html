      <h3>The Scoring System:</h3>
      <p>Coaches can select players and teams, these two types of selections get points slightly differently.
      <br>
      <ul type="disc">
         <li>Players get points by scoring goals. Each goal scored gets you a point.</li>
           <ul type="circle">
	     <li>For example, if you have Zach Tuohy in your team and he scores 6 goals, you get 6 points added to your score for the week.</li>
	         </ul>
	   <br>
	       <li>A coach's lowest scoring player each week will not be counted towards their score (essentially acting like a sub).</li>
	   <br>
         <li>Teams get points by limiting opposition goals.</li>
           <ul type="circle">
	     <li>If the team's opposition scores:</li>
              <ul type="square">
	        <li>less than 6 goals then you score 8 points</li>
	        <li>less than 10 goals then you score 4 points</li>
	        <li>less than 15 goals then you score 2 points</li>
	        <li>more than 20 goals then you score -2 points</li>
	      </ul>  
	   </ul>
      </ul>
      </p>
      
      <br>
      
      <h3>How the Draft is going to work:</h3>
      
      <p>Due to the new scoring system, the draft is altered slightly.<br>
              <ul type="disc">
	        <li>Draft picks will be in snake order (eg. 1,2,3,3,2,1) and a player can choose between picking a player or picking a team defence.</li>
	        <li>Each coach has to pick 1 team and 6 players (no more, no less).</li>
	        <li>No player or team can be chosen by two coaches.</li>
	        <li>All challenges to any draft picks need to be raised before the beginning of round one (check your teams!).</li>
	      </ul>
      </p>
      
      <br>
      
      <h3>How Trading works:</h3>
      
      <p>Players can trade players in two different ways.<br>
        <ol type="1">
	  <li>Coach to Coach </li>
              <ul type="disc">
	        <li>You can make any number of player-for-player or team-for-team trades with another coach that agrees to the trade.</li>
	        <li>The right is reserved to deny any anti-competitive trades.</li>
	      </ul>
	  <br>
	  <li>Waiver Wire</li>
              <ul type="disc">
	        <li>Any player or team that is not in any coaches team can be traded for.</li>
	        <li>Priority of trades will be given in reverse-ladder order.</li>
	        <li>A maximum of two trades can be made each week.</li>
	        <li>A player or team that has been traded out will only be available on the waiver wire after the completion of the following round.</li>
	      </ul>
        </ol> 

      </p>
